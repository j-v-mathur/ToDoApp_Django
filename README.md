# ToDoApp_Django
This Is A ToDo App With CRUD Functionality Created On Django.

This includes a project that i named todo in which i created another app called home.
I have created all templates and codes from scratch.
Templates are made with bootstrap 5 with a touch of custom css.

This App Adds ToDo title & Its Descriptions On Hompage & Shows Title On The Hompage As well, On Clicking 
The Button Corresponding Of A Title It Takes User To A new Page Where User Can See Their Task And Description,
User Can Delete Or Update Them On The Same Page.
This Way there Are 2 End Points In This App.
